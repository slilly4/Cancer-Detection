# Histopathologic Cancer Detection
This project endeavors to identify whether metastatic cancer is detectable in small image patches from digital pathology scans. The goal of the project is to predict whether a region of a patch contains at least one pixel of tumor tissue.

The data and guidelines for this task are available on Kaggle, at the following link location:

To accomplish this task, I will leverage Keras to train deep learning network for the purposes of image classification. For the purposes of this project, I will experiment with three types of CNN architecture: VGG, Inception, and ResNet, and I will compare their performance using binary cross entropy loss, accuracy, recall, and precision.
